    "content": "&emsp;Sometimes the things you love the most disappear suddenly. When my father died it was like nothing really changed for me, and that continues to be true. All I really have is the knowledge that he died, and that hurts for some reason even though I don't want it to. You may recognize today as the 2nd anniversary of his death, you may not. I hardly even remembered. When my dad died his life insurance paid out so we weren't really in a lot of trouble. The funeral was surprisingly simple. My cousin handled most everything anyway. Mostly I stared at a screen up till the funeral. I put out a lot of posts that month about things that didn't matter, and watched a lot of movies and played a lot of games and that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;I remember being really hungry during my dad's funeral. One of my earliest memories is of a funeral. My grandma's. I remember my aunt and my mother bound to her casket by their tears, and I started to cry too. I think I may have been about 2. My brother did not even exist yet. I started crying for some reason I couldn't understand, maybe it was my first moment of conscious empathy even if I didn't know what I was feeling. My cousin came to comfort me. He's only 7 years older than me so about 9, but he seemed so much larger than life at that moment, and has my entire life. He asked me if I was hungry. I don't think I was able to eke out a coherent response, but he brought me over to a table with bread and I took a bite, and it was soft and milky and so tenderly sweet and I stopped crying. I was hungry.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;So would it be weird to describe my father as something, somebody that I loved most? Almost nothing\u2019s changed. When I went away for college, I wouldn\u2019t speak to my father for months at a time. When they lived separately I wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to him until summer came, and when they lived together I felt I could never utter a word that came purely out of love and not some primitive imitation of what I\u2019ve seen on screen. My mother is and has been lonely for 20 years. My brother is grieving but he will overcome. I will continue to exist until I don\u2019t. For now I sit in a room of stuff I\u2019ve accumulated over the years of things I love. Hundreds, probably thousands of dollars of stuff. None of them are my father, none of them are my mother. Sometimes I worry that I won\u2019t cry when my mother dies.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&emsp;I\u2019ve heard people say the phrase: child of divorce and I do feel bad for them but I say \u201Cgood for them!\u201D because in the end their parents are still people who just need to go their separate ways now, but I can\u2019t because how perverse would it be to respond with \u201CI am a child of marriage\u201D? As if I were just rubbing my completely solid and foundational sound family in their face, though it\u2019s not as if I were saying \u201CI am a child of love!\u201D I\u2019ve met people who are children of love, I\u2019ve loved people who are children of love where marriage is just a side benefit of love, due in part to some perverted form of jealousy perhaps. And it\u2019s easy to admit I am jealous because that\u2019s just the truth and there are few things I long for more, because sometimes I really just hate feeling like a child of marriage. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI won\u2019t be coming back. Thank you for the years.\r\n"

He didn\u2019t eat like crap and he tried not to overwork himself and he would always do things with a smile on his face and he died of a heart attack anyways. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night. Right now I can feel my eyes burning into my skull as if they were so dry that they burned the tears on contact. Mom couldn\u2019t do anything tonight, but she still has to eat. So I made chili. I like to make chilli you just throw a bunch of random stuff into a bot with tomato paste and random spices and it pretty much just works. You get like potatoes and some ground beef and onions. Cutting onions suck. The juices hurt your eyes like hell. I didn\u2019t cry when i heard the news, but when I cut those onions they bled tears and they didn\u2019t stop for hours."]

And then again and again and again until it lost its purpose, it was useless now as a racket. And I chose to do that, because after the first hit there was a second and a third and a fourth and a fifth and I stepped outside into the cool night air and found I wanted to call my mom for some reason. Not really for some reason I suppose. I feel that way a lot I think but I never do. I dread those calls. Calls I used to be denied are now a forced part of my life, one week at a time. So I\u2019m confused why I would want to call her. Not once in my life have I confided in my mother anything of importance to me and I can\u2019t for the life of me understand why I feel this way when it\u2019s there\u2019s just me to deal with it. The reason was very stupid but they got in my head, because that\u2019s what these idiots do and I hated that feeling so much, not the way they made me feel, but the way I felt about how I reacted. Like all I were was a vessel for a body I have no control over. We laughed about it when I came back in, it was funny I guess. I\u2019m glad we could laugh about it."]

But still it\u2019s no fun, except for when things click. Like that is pretty much the only time that calculus is fun. All the other math classes are interesting at the very least, graph theory, and probability are probably some of my favorite classes which just directly contradicts what I said earlier but doesn\u2019t mean I particularly enjoy sitting in lecture for two hours at a time watching some dude write numbers and letters on a board. Math is interesting but I wouldn\u2019t dedicate my life to it and recently we\u2019ve been working on a project, me and Joel. I think it\u2019s gonna be great, he\u2019s always so supportive.

I shared a bed with my brother for pretty much all of my childhood and found out that I could only sleep knowing that my brother was in the same room as me. Pretty much everyday for that week I would wait up for my dad to return home from work at around 12am and once I heard the sound of his footsteps coming out the stairs I would greet him crying and he would take me to bed and tuck me in. My mom took to sleeping in that room herself soon after. I have a roommate now too, and I think I prefer it to a singles room, being in a room by yourself is kind of depressing, and as long as we\u2019re sitting in that room together we\u2019re not alone. I can imagine it would be miserable in a room by yourself when you don\u2019t make an effort to go out much like me. I couldn\u2019t imagine the feeling of being all alone in a huge house in the middle of the suburbs, your children 1000 miles away and your wife pulling herself out of orbit. It scares me. It terrifies me."]

We got the Zombieland with the guy from the social network we saw that one in theaters when it came out, we got the 28 years later, and something Joel says is an \u201cabsolute cult classic super epic 420 blaze it\u201d super spectacular movie experience called House of a 1000 corpses, so if this is just not the greatest horror film of all time I might genuinely have to kill him and he agreed so."]

It wasn\u2019t that serious oh yeah I\u2019m currently 18 years of age? Kind of old no? God I feel old sometimes. Anyways sometimes the internet is kind of weird. Before mom would call home from work and I\u2019d pick up the phone attached to the wall and she\u2019d tell me that she would be home late and that I would have to pick some stuff up from the grocery store BUT I DIGRESS. Saw it on a and that word was in the paper means to get back to the main point or something like that and I don\u2019t even have to look anything up in a big-ass dictionary or go on a computer or anything it\u2019s just on my phone I can just google it? Insane. My digression seems to have been faulty, but I really truly will get back to the point which is that I have a phone and it has the ability to invisibly connect me to people across the entire country!? And I still can\u2019t stay connected? Why is it so hard to talk to somebody you desperately want to talk to? Maybe if we were more serious it wouldn\u2019t have been so hard to keep up, but we we never got to that point when we still went to the same school, and we would never have been able to a million miles apart. It\u2019s kind of my fault really, both for the messages, and for going so far away. I needed to go away though. I really did I needed to try."]
