This is where I'm going to storing my website and stuff just so I don't accidentally lose the code somehow forever, that would suck. If the website is down you can always just download the files and run them in whatever IDE you've got. Make sure to hold on to everything that was important to you at some point. Sometimes I look back at my shitty elementary school code and laugh but it's great to hold on to stuff you don't think you need. As long as there's something for me to cling to it's not really gone, and I liked being a kid and I'll hold onto those memories despite everything.
